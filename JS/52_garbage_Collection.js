// Garbage collection is an automatic process in JavaScript that frees up memory that is no longer being used by a program. It's an important feature of the language because it helps prevent memory leaks and other memory-related issues.

// In JavaScript, the garbage collector works by tracking the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects. When an object is no longer in use, the garbage collector identifies it and frees up the memory it was using.

// There are different algorithms used by different JavaScript engines for garbage collection. One common approach is the mark-and-sweep algorithm, which involves traversing the entire object graph to identify objects that are no longer in use and then freeing up their memory.

// In general, developers don't need to worry too much about garbage collection in JavaScript, as it is handled automatically by the language. However, there are a few things to keep in mind to help ensure efficient garbage collection:

// Avoid creating unnecessary objects: Every object created in JavaScript takes up memory, so it's important to avoid creating unnecessary objects.

// Use let and const instead of var: The let and const keywords were introduced in ES6 and have better scoping than var, which can help with garbage collection.

// Be careful with closures: Closures can cause memory leaks if not used properly, as they can keep references to objects that should be garbage collected.

// Use the delete operator: When an object property is no longer needed, using the delete operator can help free up memory.

// Overall, garbage collection is an important aspect of the JavaScript runtime environment, and understanding how it works can help developers write more efficient code.

// create an object
let obj = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

// create a reference to the object
let ref = obj;

// set obj to null to remove the reference
obj = null;

// at this point, the object is no longer being used and can be garbage collected


// In this example, we create an object obj with properties name and age. We then create a reference to that object with the variable ref. When we set obj to null, we remove the reference to the object, and it is no longer being used in the program. At this point, the garbage collector can identify the object as no longer needed and free up the memory it was using.

// Note that the garbage collector in JavaScript is designed to work automatically, so we don't need to explicitly call it or do anything special to trigger it. It runs in the background and continuously monitors the memory usage of the program, freeing up memory when it's no longer needed.
