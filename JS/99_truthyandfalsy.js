// In JavaScript, "truthy" and "falsy" are terms used to describe the boolean evaluation of non-boolean values. JavaScript uses type coercion to convert non-boolean values to boolean when necessary, such as in conditional statements or logical operations.

// A "truthy" value is a value that is considered true when evaluated in a boolean context. It may not be an actual boolean value (true or false), but it is treated as true. Examples of truthy values in JavaScript include:

// Non-empty strings: Any non-empty string, such as "Hello" or "0".
// Numbers: Any non-zero number, including positive and negative numbers, as well as decimals.
// Objects: All objects, including arrays and functions, are considered truthy.
// Arrays: Even empty arrays ([]), which are considered objects, are truthy.
// Non-zero BigInt: BigInt values other than 0n are truthy.
// Non-null values: Null is considered falsy, but any non-null value (including undefined) is considered truthy.

// On the other hand, a "falsy" value is a value that is considered false when evaluated in a boolean context. Examples of falsy values in JavaScript include:

// Boolean false: The boolean value false itself is falsy.
// Empty strings: An empty string ("") is considered falsy.
// Number zero: The number 0 is falsy.
// NaN: The special value NaN (Not-a-Number) is considered falsy.
// Null: The null value is falsy.
// Undefined: The undefined value is falsy.

// When using these values in conditional statements or logical operations, JavaScript will automatically convert them to their corresponding boolean representation (true or false) based on their truthiness or falsiness.

// For example, in an if statement:
if ("Hello") {
    // This code block will execute because "Hello" is a truthy value.
    console.log("Truthy value");
  }

  
// And in a logical operation:
var result = "Hello" || "World";
// The value of result will be "Hello" because it is the first truthy value encountered in the logical OR operation.

// Understanding truthy and falsy values is important when working with conditionals, comparisons, and logical operations in JavaScript, as it allows for more flexible and concise code.
