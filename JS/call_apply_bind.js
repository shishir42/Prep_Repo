// In JavaScript, call, apply, and bind are methods that allow you to control the this value inside a function and pass arguments to it in a flexible way. Here's a brief summary of their purposes:

// call: The call method invokes a function with a specified this value and allows you to pass arguments to the function one by one. This can be useful for calling a function with a different this value than the default one, or for passing arguments from an array or object.

// apply: The apply method is similar to call, but it allows you to pass arguments to the function as an array. This can be useful for calling a function with a variable number of arguments, or for passing arguments from an array or object.

// bind: The bind method returns a new function with a bound this value and optionally some pre-specified arguments. This can be useful for creating a new function that has a fixed this value, or for creating a function with some arguments pre-filled.
