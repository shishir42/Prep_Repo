// Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

// JavaScript is often referred to as a "single-threaded" language because it has a single call stack, which means that only one piece of code can be executed at a time. This means that JavaScript code is executed in a sequential and synchronous manner, and that only one statement can be executed at a time.

// The single-threaded nature of JavaScript is due to its original design as a scripting language for web browsers, where it was primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Since web browsers are single-threaded environments, JavaScript was also designed to be single-threaded to ensure compatibility and predictable behavior across different browsers and platforms.

// However, it's important to note that while JavaScript itself is single-threaded, web browsers and Node.js environments are not necessarily single-threaded. Web browsers and Node.js environments provide APIs and mechanisms for performing asynchronous and concurrent operations, such as making network requests, handling user events, and running background tasks, while still maintaining the single-threaded nature of JavaScript code execution.

// For example, web browsers provide the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions for scheduling delayed and periodic tasks, and the XMLHttpRequest and fetch() APIs for making network requests asynchronously. Node.js provides similar APIs, such as the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions, as well as support for running multiple Node.js processes and using worker threads for concurrent execution.

// So, while JavaScript itself is single-threaded, web browsers and Node.js environments provide ways to work around this limitation and enable concurrent and asynchronous operations.

console.log("Hello, world!");

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Delayed message");
}, 1000);

console.log("Goodbye, world!");

// This code will log "Hello, world!" and "Goodbye, world!" to the console in order, and then schedule a delayed message to be logged to the console after one second. The output of this code will be:

// This is because the console.log() statements are executed synchronously and sequentially, while the setTimeout() function is asynchronous and does not block the execution of the rest of the code.

// When setTimeout() is called, it schedules the anonymous function to be executed after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (or one second), and then returns immediately. This means that the rest of the code can continue to execute while waiting for the delay to expire.

// Once the delay has expired, the anonymous function is added to the event queue, and will be executed by the event loop when it gets to it. In this case, the anonymous function logs "Delayed message" to the console.

// So even though JavaScript is single-threaded, the setTimeout() function allows for the execution of code to be delayed and to continue executing while waiting for the delay to expire, enabling asynchronous behavior in JavaScript.
