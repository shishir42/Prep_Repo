// A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn’t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

const add = (x, y) => x + y;

const thunk = () => add(2, 3);

thunk(); // 5

// What are asynchronous thunks
// The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,

function fetchData(fn) {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((json) => fn(json));
  }
  
  const asyncThunk = function () {
    return fetchData(function getData(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });
  };
  
  asyncThunk();

//   The getData function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.
