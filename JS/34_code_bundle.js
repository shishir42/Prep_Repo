// Code bundling is the process of combining multiple JavaScript files into a single file, typically for use in a web application. Code bundling is important for several reasons:

// Reduced HTTP requests: By bundling multiple files into a single file, you can reduce the number of HTTP requests that a web page needs to make to download all of its JavaScript files. This can improve the page load time and overall performance of the application.

// Improved caching: When multiple files are bundled into a single file, the browser can cache the entire bundle, rather than caching each file separately. This can reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded on subsequent page loads and improve the overall performance of the application.

// Smaller file sizes: Code bundling can also help to reduce the size of the JavaScript files that are sent to the browser. This is because bundling allows you to remove any duplicate code or unused modules, resulting in smaller file sizes.

// Easier development: Bundling multiple JavaScript files into a single file can make it easier to manage and develop your application. This is because it reduces the number of files that you need to manage, and makes it easier to organize and structure your code.

// Compatibility: Bundling can help ensure that your application is compatible with different browsers and devices, as it allows you to transpile your code into a format that can be understood by all modern web browsers.

// Overall, code bundling is an important technique for optimizing the performance, organization, and compatibility of web applications. It can help reduce the number of HTTP requests, improve caching, reduce file sizes, and simplify development.
