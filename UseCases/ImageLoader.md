Creating a low-level design implementation for an image loader library involves defining the internal components, classes, and their interactions. Here's a possible low-level design for an image loader library:

1. ImageLoader:
   * Responsibilities:
     * Exposes APIs for loading images.
     * Manages the cache for storing and retrieving images.
     * Handles the actual loading and displaying of images.
     * Implements lazy loading functionality.
2. CacheManager:
   * Responsibilities:
     * Stores images in memory or on disk.
     * Provides methods for retrieving and storing images.
     * Handles cache eviction strategies if the cache exceeds a certain size or time limit.
3. ImageLoaderComponent:
   * Responsibilities:
     * Receives the image URL as a prop.
     * Renders a placeholder image while the actual image is being loaded.
     * Updates the component's state when the image is loaded or an error occurs.
     * Handles image resizing and display options.
4. ImageRequest:
   * Responsibilities:
     * Contains the image URL and other relevant information.
     * Tracks the progress of the image loading process.
     * Handles cancellation of the request if necessary.
5. ImageDownloader:
   * Responsibilities:
     * Utilizes platform-specific APIs or third-party libraries for downloading images.
     * Provides progress updates during the download process.
     * Supports cancellation of image downloads.
6. LazyLoadManager:
   * Responsibilities:
     * Observes the scroll position of the container or parent components.
     * Determines which images should be loaded based on the current scroll position.
     * Triggers the loading of images when they come into the viewport or close to it.
     * Handles unloading of images that move out of the viewport to optimize memory usage.

The LazyLoadManager component interacts with the ImageLoader and CacheManager to load and unload images dynamically based on the user's scroll position.

To implement lazy loading, you would need to incorporate the following additional steps:

1. Set up event listeners or scroll observers to detect the scroll position of the container or parent components where images will be lazy loaded.
2. Determine which images are currently in the viewport or close to it based on the scroll position.
3. When an image enters the viewport or is close to it, trigger the ImageLoader component to load the image.
4. When an image moves out of the viewport, notify the LazyLoadManager to unload the image, freeing up memory resources.
5. Implement strategies to handle cases where the user scrolls quickly or changes the scroll direction, ensuring that the appropriate images are loaded and unloaded in a timely manner.

By incorporating these steps, you can achieve lazy loading functionality in your image loader library. Lazy loading can significantly improve the performance of your app by reducing initial loading times and optimizing memory usage.
