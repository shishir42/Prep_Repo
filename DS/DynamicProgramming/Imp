0-1 Knapsack (6)
1. Subset sum 
2. Equal sum partition 
3. Count of subset sum 
4. Minimum subset sum difference 
5. Target sum 
6. No of subset of given difference 

Knapsack
- Fractional Knapsack (greedy)
- 0/1
- Unbounded Knapsack

                    I1      I2      I3      I4
weight arr  wt[]    1        3       4       4
value arr   val[]   1        4       5       7

W (capacity) Max Weight 7

Select the item in such a way that you can have maximize your profit with in limit of 7kg of bag

Unbounded Knapsack (5)
- Rod cutting
- Coin change (Max no of ways)
- Coin change II (min number of coins)
- Maximum Ribbon cut 


Longest common subsequence Introduction
- Largest common substring
- print LCS
- shortest common super-sequence 
- print scs
- min no of insertion and deletion a->b
- largest repeating subsequence 
- length of largest subsequence of a which is a substring 
- subsequence pattern matching 
- count how many times 'a' appear as subsequence in 'b'
- largest palindrome subsequence 
- largest palindrome substring 
- count of palindrome subsequence 
- count of palindrome substring 
- min no of deletion in a string to make it a palindrome 
- min no of insertion in a string to make it a palindrome
