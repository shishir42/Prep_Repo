//Methods are functions that are associated with a particular type. Classes, structures, and enumerations can all define instance methods, which encapsulate specific tasks and functionality for working with an instance of a given type. Classes, structures, and enumerations can also define type methods, which are associated with the type itself. Type methods are similar to class methods in Objective-C.


class Counter {
    var count = 0
    func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
    func increment(by amount: Int) {
        count += amount
    }
    func reset() {
        count = 0
    }
}

let counter = Counter()
// the initial counter value is 0
counter.increment()
// the counter's value is now 1
counter.increment(by: 5)
// the counter's value is now 6
counter.reset()
// the counter's value is now 0


//The self Property
//Every instance of a type has an implicit property called self, which is exactly equivalent to the instance itself. You use the self property to refer to the current instance within its own instance methods.
//
//func increment() {
//    self.count += 1
//}


struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    func isToTheRightOf(x: Double) -> Bool {
        return self.x > x
    }
}
let somePoint = Point(x: 4.0, y: 5.0)
if somePoint.isToTheRightOf(x: 1.0) {
    print("This point is to the right of the line where x == 1.0")
}

//Modifying Value Types from Within Instance Methods
//Structures and enumerations are value types. By default, the properties of a value type can’t be modified from within its instance methods.

struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    mutating func moveBy(x deltaX: Double, y deltaY: Double) {
        x += deltaX
        y += deltaY
    }
}
var somePoint = Point(x: 1.0, y: 1.0)
somePoint.moveBy(x: 2.0, y: 3.0)
print("The point is now at (\(somePoint.x), \(somePoint.y))")
// Prints "The point is now at (3.0, 4.0)"

//Assigning to self Within a Mutating Method
struct Point_ {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    mutating func moveBy(x deltaX: Double, y deltaY: Double) {
        self = Point(x: x + deltaX, y: y + deltaY)
    }
}

//Mutating methods for enumerations can set the implicit self parameter to be a different case from the same enumeration:

enum TriStateSwitch {
    case off, low, high
    mutating func next() {
        switch self {
        case .off:
            self = .low
        case .low:
            self = .high
        case .high:
            self = .off
        }
    }
}
var ovenLight = TriStateSwitch.low
ovenLight.next()
// ovenLight is now equal to .high
ovenLight.next()
// ovenLight is now equal to .off

//Type Methods
//You can also define methods that are called on the type itself. These kinds of methods are called type methods. You indicate type methods by writing the static keyword before the method’s func keyword. Classes can use the class keyword instead, to allow subclasses to override the superclass’s implementation of that method.

class SomeClass {
    class func someTypeMethod() {
        // type method implementation goes here
    }
}
SomeClass.someTypeMethod()
