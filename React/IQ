* class based or functional base
* JS - Hoisting - working - only work with var- why not with let and var (+5) also w.r.t to normal and arrow functions (let or const or var are hoisted but var are initialized with undefined and let are const are in temporal zone where access are not possible, until the let and const are defined you will not be able to access)

* js normal function vs react custom hooks (you can use react js life cycle method inside custom hook)
* library vs framework ()
* Can react hooks covered the all life cycle methods: No, 3 methods are not covered,  getsnapshotbeforeupdate, getderivedstatefromerror and componentdidcatch.
* React Redux vs React-Context API (resolved for prop drilling)(we can used both)
* Map vs forEach (in context of reactjs)
* Will redux save the data even after the browser refresh - no, it will not saved the data after page refresh, if you using redux-persist then it will saved.
* Why use state inside react component-> React flow is different compared to other mechanism like to reflect the data in the view, component need to re-render otherwise it will not reflect the data, Here data is store in the state, once state is updating then automatically view will re-render and you will see the updated data.
Also props will help to update the data in the UI but its take the data from outside not the inside of component.
* react js 18 - features https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18

HTML
* sematic tags
* html elements and tags
* meta tag and properties 
* document.createElement and document.createFragments
* DOM
* local storage vs session storage 
* list out the block elements
* innerHtml 
* make a list in js 
*    

* css
* absolute vs relative vs static position - parent child1 child2 (+1)
* flexbox
* display: none and visibility: hidden (+1)
* advantages of css
* 
* put div side by side without modified the code 
<div>
  <h1>T1</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <div>
    <h1>T2</h1>
  </div>
</div>

div {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: top;
  margin-right: 20px;
}
*If the parent element has a relative position and the child element has an absolute position, the child element will be aligned based on the coordinates specified in its CSS code. Specifically, the top, right, bottom, and left properties of the child element's CSS code will determine its position relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, which in this case is the parent element.

For example, if the child element has the following CSS code:
position: absolute;
top: 50px;
left: 100px;

This means that the child element will be positioned 50 pixels down from the top of the parent element, and 100 pixels to the right of the left edge of the parent element. The child element's position is absolute, which means it is taken out of the normal flow of the document and positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (in this case, the parent element).

* Here are some coding approaches you can use to design a screen using responsive design:

Use a Mobile-First Approach: Start by designing for the smallest screen size (mobile devices) and then scale up to larger screen sizes. This approach will help you to prioritize the most important content and ensure that it is easily accessible on smaller screens.

Use CSS Media Queries: CSS Media Queries are used to apply styles based on the screen size. You can use Media Queries to define different styles for different screen sizes. For example:

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens smaller than 768px */
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens larger than 768px */
}
Use a Responsive Grid System: Use a responsive grid system like Bootstrap or Foundation to layout content. A grid system allows you to create a layout that is flexible and adaptable to different screen sizes. For example:
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
    Content
  </div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
    Content
  </div>
</div>

In this example, the content will be displayed in a two-column layout on desktop screens (col-md-6) and a one-column layout on mobile screens (col-xs-12).

Use Flexible Images: Use CSS to make images flexible and adaptable to different screen sizes. For example:

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
