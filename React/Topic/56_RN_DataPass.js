// There are several ways to pass data between components in React Native:

// Props: Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. The parent component can pass any data, including primitive data types, objects, or functions, as props to the child component. The child component can then access and use the data passed to it via props.

// Context: Context is a feature in React that allows data to be passed down the component tree without explicitly passing props from every parent to child component. It is useful for sharing data that needs to be accessed by many components at different levels in the component tree.

// Redux: Redux is a state management library that can be used to manage application-level state. It provides a central store where the application's state is stored and can be accessed from any component in the application.

// Events: Components can emit events that other components can listen to and respond to. This can be useful for communicating between sibling or unrelated components that don't have a parent-child relationship.

// React Navigation: React Navigation is a library that provides a way to handle navigation and routing in a React Native app. It allows passing parameters between screens and accessing those parameters in the screen components.

// Async Storage: Async Storage is a simple, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that can be used to store data between sessions or across different components.

// These are some of the common ways to pass data between components in React Native. The choice of the method depends on the specific use case and the complexity of the application.
