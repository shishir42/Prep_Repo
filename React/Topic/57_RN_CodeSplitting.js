// Code splitting is a technique in which the application code is divided into smaller chunks, each of which can be loaded on demand, as and when required, instead of loading everything at once during the initial load of the application. This helps to optimize the performance of the application and reduces the initial load time.

// How Does Code Splitting Work in React Native?
// React Native allows developers to implement code splitting in their applications by using tools like the React Loadable library or the built-in lazy and Suspense components.

// The lazy component allows for a component to be loaded only when it is needed, and the Suspense component allows for the loading of the component to be handled. This means that instead of loading the entire application at once, the application will only load the parts of the code that are necessary for the user to see.

// To implement code splitting in a React Native application, a developer would typically start by splitting the code into smaller chunks, with each chunk corresponding to a specific feature or section of the application. Then, the code can be loaded on demand as the user navigates through the application.

// By utilizing code splitting, developers can improve the performance of their React Native applications and provide a better user experience, since the application will load faster and consume fewer resources on the user's device.
