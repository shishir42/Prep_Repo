// What is the role of fabric in React Native?

// Fabric is a modern type of architecture that was first created in 2018 and aims to address some of React Native’s performance issues. Fabric modernizes the framework’s rendering layer by allowing specified priority tasks to be executed synchronously and, therefore, quicker. 

// Fabric is a re-architecture of the React Native core aimed at improving performance, reliability, and extensibility. It is a major update to React Native that replaces many of the core components of the framework, including the JavaScript engine and the bridge.

// The main role of Fabric in React Native is to provide a more efficient and flexible runtime for building high-performance mobile applications. Some of the key features of Fabric include:

// Improved performance: Fabric provides a more lightweight runtime, optimized rendering pipeline, and improved threading model, all of which contribute to faster startup times, smoother animations, and overall better performance.

// Better reliability: Fabric includes improved error handling, crash reporting, and debugging tools, making it easier for developers to identify and fix issues in their applications.

// Enhanced extensibility: Fabric provides a more modular architecture that makes it easier for developers to extend and customize the framework with their own native components and modules.

// Improved developer experience: Fabric includes a number of developer-friendly features, such as better hot reloading and faster build times, that improve the overall development experience.


// The Fabric architecture is a new architecture for React Native that was introduced in version 0.60. It replaces the older bridge-based architecture and aims to improve the performance, stability, and extensibility of React Native apps.

// Here's a brief overview of how the Fabric architecture works:

// Threading model: In the Fabric architecture, React Native runs on a single background thread with a priority queue of UI operations. This helps to avoid jank (or stuttering) by prioritizing the most important UI operations and minimizing the time spent on background tasks.

// Improved layout engine: Fabric includes an improved layout engine that is faster and more efficient than the previous one. It uses Flexbox for layout and can handle more complex UI designs.

// Native modules and TurboModules: Native modules are now called TurboModules in the Fabric architecture, and they provide a way to write platform-specific code in a more efficient way. TurboModules are precompiled, which reduces the overhead of calling native code from JavaScript.

// Improved animations: The Fabric architecture includes a new animation system that is more performant and supports more advanced animations.

// Optimizations for JavaScript execution: Fabric includes several optimizations to improve the performance of JavaScript execution, including bytecode caching, faster function calls, and more efficient garbage collection.

// Overall, the Fabric architecture is designed to provide a more stable, performant, and extensible platform for building React Native apps. It achieves this by introducing several improvements to the underlying architecture and optimizing the performance of key components.
