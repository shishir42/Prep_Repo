// The Profiler measures how often a React application renders and what the “cost” of rendering is. Its purpose is to help identify parts of an application that are slow and may benefit from optimizations such as memoization.

// Note:
// Profiling adds some additional overhead, so it is disabled in the production build.
// To opt into production profiling, React provides a special production build with profiling enabled. Read more about how to use this build at fb.me/react-profiling
