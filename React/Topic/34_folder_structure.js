// There is no one "best" folder structure for a React project, as it largely depends on the specific needs and preferences of the project and development team. That being said, there are some common conventions and best practices that can be followed.

// One common approach is the "feature-based" or "domain-based" folder structure, where files are grouped by the feature or domain they belong to. For example, all components, actions, reducers, and selectors related to a particular feature would be grouped together in a folder named after that feature.

// Another approach is the "component-based" folder structure, where files are grouped by the type of component they are. For example, all reusable components would be placed in a "components" folder, while all container components would be placed in a "containers" folder.

// Regardless of the approach taken, it is generally a good idea to keep the folder structure organized and easy to navigate, and to separate concerns as much as possible. It is also important to be consistent throughout the project, so that all team members are able to understand and navigate the codebase easily.

// Sure, here is an example of a comprehensive folder structure that covers different scenarios and is based on the feature-based approach:
