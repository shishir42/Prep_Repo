// React Portals is a feature that allows you to render a component's subtree outside of its parent component, and attach it to a different part of the DOM tree. This is useful when you want to render a child component that has a higher z-index than its parent, or when you need to render a component outside of its natural hierarchy.

// Here's an example of how to use React Portals:

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function Modal(props) {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    props.children,
    document.getElementById('modal-root')
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <Modal>
        <h2>Modal Content</h2>
        <p>This content will be rendered outside of the parent component.</p>
      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
}

// In this example, the Modal component is defined to accept a children prop, which is rendered using ReactDOM.createPortal. The second argument to createPortal specifies the target element where the content should be rendered, which is an element with the id "modal-root" in this case.

// The App component renders a Modal component, and passes some content as its children. When the Modal component is rendered, its content will be attached to the modal-root element, which is outside of its parent component's hierarchy.

// Using React Portals in this way allows you to render components in a more flexible way, without having to worry about z-index or parent-child relationships. It can be especially useful for creating modal dialogs, tooltips, and other UI components that need to be rendered outside of their parent component's hierarchy.
