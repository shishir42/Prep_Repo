// It's is process of tree comparison which is used by react to update the real dom.

// Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the UI in response to changes in the underlying data model. It's a core part of React's rendering engine and is responsible for making sure that the rendered output of a component tree matches the expected state of the application.

// During reconciliation, React compares the current state of the component tree with the previous state and determines what changes need to be made to the UI. This involves creating a new virtual DOM tree based on the updated state, comparing it to the previous virtual DOM tree, and updating only the parts of the DOM that have changed.

// React's reconciliation algorithm is highly optimized and uses a number of strategies to minimize the number of changes that need to be made to the UI. For example, it uses a diffing algorithm to compare the current and previous virtual DOM trees and identifies only the parts of the tree that have changed, rather than updating the entire tree.

// Reconciliation in React is a key feature that allows developers to build highly dynamic and responsive user interfaces without having to worry about the low-level details of updating the DOM. It's an important part of React's performance and allows applications to handle large amounts of data and respond quickly to user interactions.
