// In the context of React, "intercepts" could refer to a couple of different concepts, so I'll briefly explain both of them:

// Intercepting component lifecycle methods: React provides a set of component lifecycle methods, such as componentDidMount() and componentDidUpdate(), that allow developers to hook into different stages of a component's lifecycle. These methods can be used to perform actions such as fetching data or updating the UI based on changes to the component's state or props.

// "Intercepts" in this context refer to intercepting these lifecycle methods to perform additional actions or modify the component's behavior. For example, a developer might create a higher-order component (HOC) that intercepts the componentDidMount() method to log information about when the component is mounted.

// Intercepting HTTP requests: Another possible interpretation of "intercepts" in the context of React is related to intercepting HTTP requests made by the application. This can be done using a tool like Axios or a similar library that allows developers to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses.
// By intercepting HTTP requests, developers can perform actions like adding authentication headers, modifying request parameters, or handling errors more gracefully. This can be especially useful in larger React applications that make frequent API calls or interact with backend servers.
