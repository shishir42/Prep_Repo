// React Fiber is a new algorithm for rendering updates in React that was introduced in React 16. It is designed to improve the performance and user experience of React applications, especially for large and complex applications.

// The main goal of React Fiber is to improve the way that React handles updates to the virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM that React uses to keep track of changes to the UI. With Fiber, React can now handle updates more efficiently by breaking them up into smaller, prioritized chunks that can be spread out over multiple frames. This allows React to make better use of the available resources and prevent the UI from freezing or becoming unresponsive during updates.

// Some of the key features of React Fiber include:

// Incremental rendering: Fiber allows React to split up large updates into smaller "units of work" that can be processed incrementally. This allows React to start rendering updates as soon as possible, even if the entire update hasn't been processed yet.

// Priority and scheduling: Fiber introduces a new priority system that allows React to prioritize updates based on their importance and schedule them accordingly. This allows React to ensure that important updates are processed quickly and that less important updates don't block the UI.

// Error boundaries: Fiber introduces the concept of "error boundaries", which are components that can catch and handle errors that occur during rendering. This can help prevent errors from crashing the entire UI and allow developers to handle errors in a more graceful way.

// Overall, React Fiber is a significant improvement over the previous rendering algorithm in React and is a major reason why React 16 and above are able to handle larger and more complex applications with ease.
