// Redux is a popular state management library that can be used with React Native to manage the application state in a centralized and organized manner. Here are the steps involved in using Redux with React Native:

// - Installation
// Install the redux and react-redux packages using the npm install redux react-redux command.

// - Store
// * Create a store by using the createStore method from the redux library and passing in a reducer function.
// * The reducer function takes the current state and an action and returns the next state.

// - Actions
// * Create action creators that return action objects that describe changes to the state.
// * Dispatch actions using the dispatch method of the store.

// - Reducer
// * Write a reducer function that updates the state based on the action type.

// - Connect
// * Connect your React Native components to the Redux store using the connect method from the react-redux library.
// * The connect method maps the state and dispatch method of the store to props in your component.

// - Provider
// * Wrap your React Native components with the Provider component from the react-redux library and pass the store as a prop.
