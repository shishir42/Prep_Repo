// While React is not a strict MVC framework, it is often used to build applications that follow the MVC architecture pattern. Here's how the MVC pattern can be implemented in a React application:

// Model: In a React application, the model typically represents the data and state of the application. This can be managed using stateful components, such as class components or functional components that use the useState hook.

// View: In React, the view is typically represented by components that render the UI based on the data in the model. Components can receive data through props and can update the UI based on changes to the model.

// Controller: In React, the controller logic can be implemented using components that manage the state of the application and update the model based on user interactions or other events. These components can include form components, event handlers, or components that manage global state using libraries such as Redux.

// So while React does not enforce a strict separation of concerns between the model, view, and controller, it provides a flexible and scalable way to build applications that follow the MVC pattern.

// It's worth noting that React is often used in combination with other libraries and frameworks that provide more structure and support for the MVC architecture. For example, React can be used with libraries like Redux, which provide a more structured way to manage application state and implement controller logic.

// can react js follow MVC: no it is only use view, you can use modal with the help of redux
