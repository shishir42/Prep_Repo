// In React class components, there are several lifecycle methods that can be used to control the component's behavior during various phases of its life cycle. The React class component lifecycle methods are as follows:

// constructor(props): This is the first method called when a component is created. It is used to initialize state and bind event handlers.

// getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): This method is called right before rendering the component and is used to update the state based on changes to props.

// render(): This is a required method that returns the React elements that represent the component's UI.

// componentDidMount(): This method is called after the component is mounted in the DOM and is often used to fetch data from a server or initialize third-party libraries.

// shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): This method is called before re-rendering the component and is used to optimize performance by determining if the component needs to re-render.

// getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState): This method is called right before updating the component's DOM and is used to capture information from the current DOM state before it changes.

// componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot): This method is called after the component's DOM has been updated and is used to perform side effects such as updating a third-party library or sending analytics data.

// componentWillUnmount(): This method is called before the component is unmounted from the DOM and is often used to perform cleanup tasks such as unsubscribing from events or canceling timers.

// componentDidCatch(error, info): This method is called when an error occurs during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in a child component's constructor. It is used to handle errors and display a fallback UI.

// In React functional components, there are some lifecycle methods or their equivalent hooks that can be used to control the component's behavior during various phases of its life cycle. The React functional component lifecycle methods/hooks are as follows:

// useState(): This hook is used to manage state in functional components. It allows you to declare state variables and their initial values.

// useEffect(): This hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It can be used to fetch data, manipulate the DOM, or update third-party libraries.

// useContext(): This hook is used to access the context in functional components. It allows you to consume context values that are passed down from a parent component.

// useReducer(): This hook is used to manage more complex state in functional components. It allows you to handle state updates using a reducer function.

// useCallback(): This hook is used to memoize functions in functional components. It allows you to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

// useMemo(): This hook is used to memoize values in functional components. It allows you to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-computations.

// useRef(): This hook is used to create a reference to a DOM node or a value that persists across re-renders. It allows you to access and modify the underlying value without triggering a re-render.

// useLayoutEffect(): This hook is similar to useEffect(), but it is called synchronously after all DOM mutations have been applied. It can be used to manipulate the DOM immediately after it has been updated.

// useImperativeHandle(): This hook is used to expose imperative methods on a functional component. It allows you to call methods on the component's underlying DOM node or third-party library.

// The useEffect hook works similarly to the three lifecycle methods: componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. T
