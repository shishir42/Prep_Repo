SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are protocols for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers.
SSL/TLS works by binding the identities of entities such as websites and companies to cryptographic key pairs via digital documents known as X.509 certificates. Each key pair consists of a private key and a public key. The private key is kept secure, and the public key can be widely distributed via a certificate.

Understanding of pinning 
Pinning is an optional mechanism that can be used to improve the security of a service or site that relies on SSL Certificates. Pinning allows specifying a cryptographic identity that should be accepted by users visiting site/app
         
Why do we need SSL pinning?

One of the inherent risks to the SSL ecosystem is mis-issuance. This is when an unauthorized certificate is issued for a domain/host you control. This can happen with both public and private PKIs (Public Key Infrastructure)


How is SSL pinning used in Mobile applications?
When mobile applications communicate with the server, they typically use SSL to protect the transmitted data against tampering. By default SSL implementations used, apps trust any server with a certificate trusted by the Operating systems trust store, This store is a list of certificate authorities that are shipped with the operating system.

With SSL pinning, however, the application is configured to reject all but one or few predefined certificates, whenever the application connects to a server, it compares the server certificate with the pinned certificate(s) , if and only if they match the server is trusted and SSL connection is established.
