What is the difference between a Hash Table and a Dictionary?

Dictionary,

Returns an error if the key does not exist
No boxing and unboxing
Faster than a Hash table

Hashtable,

Returns NULL even if the key does not exist
Requires boxing and unboxing
Slower than a Dictionary

****

Is it possible to serialize hashtables?
No, you cannot serialize a hashtable because the .NET Framework doesn't allow the serialization of an object that implements the IDictionary interface.
