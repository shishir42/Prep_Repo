The .NET framework is a software development platform that supports an object-oriented approach. It offers services, like memory management, networking, security, and type safety.

There are a lot of components that make up the .NET framework, and some of them are as follows:

.NET Class Library
.NET Framework
Language Runtime
Application Domain
Profiling

JIT stands for Just In Time. It is a compiler in CLR responsible for the execution of .NET programs of different languages by converting them into machine code. It speeds up the code execution and supports multiple platforms.
JIT is the abbreviation of Just in Time. It is a compiler that is used to convert intermediate code into native code easily.In .NET, during execution, the code is converted into the native language, also called the byte code. This is processed by the CPU, and the framework helps with the conversion.

MSIL is the abbreviation of Microsoft Intermediate Language. It is used to provide the instructions required for operations such as memory handling, exception handling, and more. It can also provide instructions to initialize and store values and methods easily.

CLR stands for Common Language Runtime. It forms to be the most vital component of .NET as it provides the foundation for many applications to run on.
If a user writes an application in C#, it gets compiled and converted to intermediate code. After this, CLR takes up the code and works on it with respect to the following aspects:
Memory management
Security protocols
Libraries for loading
Thread management

BCL stands for Base Class Library. It comprises classes, interface, and value types. It is the foundation for building .NET Framework applications, components, and controls.

FCL stands for Framework Class Library and is a collection of reusable types, including classes, interfaces, and data types included in the .NET Framework. It is used for developing a wide variety of applications, as it provides access to system functionality.

Types in .NET Framework are either Value Type or Reference Type. A Value Type is stored in the stack and it holds the data within its own memory allocation. While a Reference Type is stored in the heap and it contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the real data.

EXE is an executable file that works as an application and it runs individually as it contains an entry point. DLL is a Dynamic Link Library which is a supportive file to other applications, and it cannot run individually.

The stack is used for static memory allocation and access to this memory is fast and simple to keep track of. Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation and memory allocation to variables that happen at run time. Accessing the heap memory is complex and slower compared to the stack.

string is immutable and fixed-length, whereas StringBuilder is mutable and variable length. The size of the .string cannot be changed, but that of the .stringbuilder can be changed.

The base class is a class whose members and functions can be inherited, and the derived class is the class that inherits those members and may also have additional properties.  

Reflection objects are used for creating type instances and obtaining type information at runtime. The classes in the System.Reflection namespace gives access to the metadata of a running program.

The Global Assembly Cache is a machine-wide code cache that is stored in a folder in the Windows directory. It stores the .NET assemblies that are specifically designated to be shared by all applications executed on the system.

Marshaling is the process of transforming types in the managed and unmanaged code.

Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a form (a stream of bytes) to be persisted or transported. Deserialization converts a stream into an object and is the opposite of serialization. These processes allow data to be stored and transferred.

An assembly is the simple collection of all of the logical units present. Logical units are entities that are required to build an application and later deploy the same using the .NET framework. It can be considered as a collection of executables and DLL files.
There are four main components of an assembly. They are as follows:
Resource: A collection of related files
MSIL: The Intermediate Language code
Metadata: The binary data of a program
Manifest: A collection of information about the assembly

Yes, it is possible to manually set a session’s out time. It can easily be done by manipulating the web.config file.

Function
- Can only return one value
- No support for exception handling using try-catch blocks
- The argument consists of only one input parameter
- A function can be called from a stored procedure

Stored Procedure
- Can return any number of values
- Supports the usage of try-catch blocks for exception handling
- Both input and output parameters are present
- The stored procedure cannot be called from a function

There are eight events as shown below that take place in an order to successfully render a page(page life cycle):
Page_PreInit
Page_Init
Page_InitComplete
Page_PreLoad
Page_Load
Page_LoadComplete
Page_PreRender
Render

What do the following acronyms in .NET stand for: IL, CIL, MSIL, CLI and JIT?

IL, or Intermediate Language, is a CPU independent partially compiled code. IL code will be compiled to native machine code using current environmental properties by Just-In-Time compiler (JIT). JIT compiler translates the IL code to an assembly code and uses the CPU architecture of the target machine to execute a .NET application. In .NET, IL is called Common Intermediate Language (CIL), and in the early .NET days it was called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).

CLI, or Common Language Infrastructure, is an open specification developed by Microsoft. It is a compiled code library used for deployment, versioning, and security. In .NET there are two CLI types: process assemblies (EXE) and library assemblies (DLL). CLI assemblies contain code in CIL, and as mentioned, during compilation of CLI programming languages, the source code is translated into CIL code rather than into platform or processor specific object code.

To summarize:

1. When compiled, source code is first translated to IL (in .NET, that is CIL, and previously called MSIL).
2. CIL is then assembled into a bytecode and a CLI assembly is created.
3. Before code execution, CLI code is passed through the runtime’s JIT compiler to generate native machine code.
4. The computer’s processor executes the native machine code.

Explain the difference between the Stack and the Heap.
The short answer would be: in the Stack are stored value types (types inherited from System.ValueType), and in the Heap are stored reference types (types inherited from System.Object).

We can say the Stack is responsible for keeping track of what is actually executing and where each executing thread is (each thread has its own Stack). The Heap, on the other hand, is responsible for keeping track of the data, or more precise objects.

How do you implement a generic action in WebAPI?
It’s not possible, as the WebAPI runtime needs to know the method signatures in advance.

***
ASP.Net
ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft to build dynamic websites, web applications, and services. It allows developers to build web applications using .NET languages like C# or Visual Basic.

ASP.NET provides a rich set of features and tools for building modern and scalable web applications, such as:

Server-side programming: Developers can write server-side code using .NET languages to create dynamic web applications that interact with databases and other server-side services.

MVC architecture: ASP.NET follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components: the Model, which represents the data; the View, which represents the user interface; and the Controller, which handles user input and directs the flow of data.

Web API: ASP.NET provides a powerful and flexible Web API framework that allows developers to create RESTful web services to expose data and functionality to other applications.

Authentication and authorization: ASP.NET provides built-in support for authentication and authorization, including support for various authentication providers such as Microsoft, Facebook, or Google, and role-based authorization.

Cross-platform support: ASP.NET Core, the latest version of ASP.NET, is a cross-platform and open-source framework that allows developers to build and run web applications on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

ASP.NET is widely used by developers and organizations to build modern and scalable web applications and services. It offers a robust set of features and tools that make it easier to build complex web applications while maintaining high performance and security.
