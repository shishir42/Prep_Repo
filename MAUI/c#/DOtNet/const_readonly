https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/0c1bb2/read-only-and-constant-in-C-Sharp/

const: compile-time constant: absolute constant, value is set during declaration, is in the IL code itself
readonly
run-time constant: can be set in the constructor/init via config file i.e. App.config, but once it initializes it can't be changed


const fields need to be initialized with declaration only, while readonly fields can be initialized at the declaration or in the constructor.
const variables can be declared in methods, while readonly fields cannot be declared in methods.
const fields cannot be used with a static modifier, while readonly fields can be used with a static modifier.
const field is a compile-time constant. The readonly field can be used for run-time constants.
