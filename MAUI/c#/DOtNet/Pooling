Object Pooling is a concept for optimal use of limited resources through software constructs. The ready-to-use objects, connections, and threads are stored in a pool (group) of objects in memory for later use. For creating a new object, it is pulled from the pool and allocated for the request. Pooling helps in improving performance and facilitates scalability.

There are four main parameters that control connection pooling behaviors in .NET as given below:
-Connect Timeout
-Min Pool Size
-Max Pool Size
-Pooling
