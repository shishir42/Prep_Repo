How do you implement the INotifyPropertyChanged interface in the ViewModel in C# Xamarin.Forms MVVM?

In C# Xamarin.Forms MVVM, the INotifyPropertyChanged interface is used to notify the View that a property in the ViewModel has changed. To implement this interface, you need to define a PropertyChanged event in the ViewModel and 
raise it whenever a property value changes.

public class MyViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    private string _myProperty;

    public string MyProperty
    {
        get { return _myProperty; }
        set
        {
            if (_myProperty != value)
            {
                _myProperty = value;
                OnPropertyChanged(nameof(MyProperty));
            }
        }
    }

    protected virtual void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName)
    {
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
    }
}

In the example above, we define a string property called MyProperty, which is bound to a control in the View. Whenever the value of MyProperty changes, we raise the PropertyChanged event and pass the name of the changed property to the event handler.

By implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface in the ViewModel, we can ensure that any changes made to the ViewModel's properties are automatically reflected in the View. This helps to maintain a clean separation of concerns and promotes a more modular, testable codebase.
