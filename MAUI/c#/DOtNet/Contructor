A constructor is a special method of the class that contains a collection of instructions and gets automatically invoked when an instance of the class is created.
There are 5 types of constructors in C#, as given below:

Default Constructor: It is without any parameters.
Parameterized Constructor: It has one parameter.
Copy Constructor: It creates an object by copying variables from another object.
Static Constructor: It is created using a static keyword and will be invoked only once for all of the instances of the class.
Private Constructor: It is created with a private specifier and does not allow other classes to derive from this class or create an instance of it.
