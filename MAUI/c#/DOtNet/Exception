Is there a way to catch multiple exceptions at once and without code duplication in c#

Yes, in C# you can catch multiple exceptions using a single catch block by using a catch block with multiple exception types separated by the | operator. This is called a "multi-catch" block.

try
{
    // Some code that might throw exceptions
}
catch (IOException | SqlException | SomeOtherException ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
    Console.WriteLine($"Exception caught: {ex.Message}");
}

***************

How is Exception Handling implemented in C#
Exception handling is done using four keywords in C#:

try – Contains a block of code for which an exception will be checked.
catch – It is a program that catches an exception with the help of exception handler.
finally – It is a block of code written to execute regardless whether an exception is caught or not.
throw – Throws an exception when a problem occurs.
